          <p>
            Humans have been captivated by the prospect of space travel ever since the birth of
            civilisation! Haven't we all gazed up at the night sky and dreamed about space? While
            deep space flight remains something out of science fiction movies like Star Trek and
            Star Wars, the significant progress achieved by commercial space enterprises thus far
            appears very promising. Someday, space travel (or even interstellar travel) might be
            accessible to everyone!
          </p>

            Below you can find the relativistic space travel calculations for various destinations.

It is approximately 4.2 light years from Earth in the constellation Centaurus, making it the closest known exoplanets to the Solar System."

TRAPPIST-1d is the least massive planet of the system and is likely to have a compact hydrogen-poor atmosphere similar to Venus, Earth, or Mars."

Ross 128 b is the nearest exoplanet around a quiet red dwarf, and is considered one of the best candidates for habitability."

It is one of the more promising candidates for potential habitability, as its parent star is at least 40% less massive than the Sun â€“ thus, it can have a lifespan of about 30 billion years or so."
